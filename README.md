# Flow - Computer science for everyone.

_Taken from the Devpost description._

## Inspiration
Flow was inspired by my own personal experiences. Computer science is one of the fastest growing fields in the world, and many go towards the field. However, computer science is a broad field. There are hundreds of different jobs and disciples in the field, and many who are interested may not know where to go, what to do, or how to do it. Flow aims to solve this problem, so anyone can go into the wonderful world of computer science without an obstacle.

## What it does
Flow, aims to give a clean and beautifully designed user interface, paired with unrivalled functionality. First, as the user enters, they are given an entry quiz, where they will be put into five major CS categories: frontend, backend, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. From there, they will be put into a specific job in this category, after a brief introduction of the category. From there, they will be taken on a dynamic pathway.

## How we built it
I built this using JavaScript for most of the main quiz frameworks and functions. I used HTML to store the website, and CSS for all the styling purposes.

## Challenges I ran into
The challenges I ran into, would probably take up the whole page. Every single thing that could go wrong, went wrong. From the styling, to the intricate flow of the quiz, many things went wrong.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The best accomplishment, however, is persevering in these mistakes. Troubleshooting and debugging taught me invaluable knowledge that no coding course could have ever taught me. So, win or not, I am grateful for the experience. I've proud of every single line of code, I have done, and it makes me feel accomplished to think that my work could be used to help others.

## What we learned
I learned a lot about many different computer science jobs and disciples, while researching questions. I learned just how big the field was, and felt optimistic for the future. I learned a lot more about animations in CSS, further gaining more knowledge in the field, and A LOT about JavaScript, and its smooth integration into HTML and CSS. It inspired me to continue using it, and to learn more about various frameworks utilizing the language, in order to use it for future projects.

## What's next for Flow
I plan to add 100s of jobs, onto the platform, for every single category and person. The questions can become much more comprehensive, and the path will be properly created and restored. The path can be a collaborative environment with different professionals from the respective jobs collaborating and editing based on their own experience. The path can also include built-in videos, to have a smoother UI, instead of simply adding links. The possibilities are endless.
